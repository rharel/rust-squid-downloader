## Squid Downloader

Squid Downloader is a command-line-operated downloader written in Rust. It can accelerate a download of content over HTTP/HTTPS by fetching and processing several chunks of it in parallel (as long as such functionality is supported by the server).

This project was my gateway to Rust. I had just finished reading the Rust Book (2nd edition) and wanted to test my understanding of the language by implementing a small-ish sized exercise --- and this is it.
